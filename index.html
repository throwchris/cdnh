    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>"The main thing in the kingdom is that man does not have to die under the curse, but can live forever." Rose M. Aluli </i></p>
    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>This message was given to the church on December 30, 1979.</i></p>


    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong>Matthew 17:1-3</strong> </span><strong class="w3-text-light-blue">And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up 
        into an high mountain apart, And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light. And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses 
        and Elias talking with him.</strong> Now we know that Moses and Elias had been dead, or gone, for many years before Jesus was born.  And we know that there was more to this than just for 
        him to be manifested as a spiritual being.  I feel like God was showing me something regarding it, but we will get to that a little later.</p> 
    
    
    <p class="w3-justify">What I want to start out in is the thing that the Lord was showing me concerning death, because this is the main thing in the kingdom: that man does not have to die 
        under the curse, but can live forever.  Now we have taught on that quite a bit.  The scripture is full of it.  I am just going to lay out what I feel God has given me.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify">Death is in everyone's body when we are born because sin is in everyone's flesh.  We are born in sin and conceived in iniquity; that's scripture.  Now Jesus died that 
        we might overcome sin in our flesh bodies. "Be ye holy even as your Father in heaven is holy."  "Be ye pure."  "Be ye perfect."  What is he saying?  This old sinful flesh can be 
        perfect, when we are born in sin and conceived in iniquity.  Do you think God would put such a thing in the scripture if it was not possible for us to become perfect?  In the flesh now, 
        he is talking about.  Jesus died that we might overcome sin in our bodies, thus destroying death. Now I am going to show you how. Adam brought death by disobedience and sin.  Jesus 
        brought life.  He says, "I come that you might have life and that you might have it more abundantly."  Now there is an eternal life and there is a physical life.  And this is where you 
        have to know the difference.  This is why we get all mixed up in the three Johns in our mind because we do not have the discerning of the Spirit to know what he is talking about; 
        eternal life and life in the flesh.  He came to destroy the curse.  That is what Jesus said, "I come to destroy the curse of the law."  We were born under the law in sin, the law of 
        man, not the law of the Ten Commandment law, but the law of sin that is born in all flesh.</p>
    
    <p class="w3-justify">What was the curse unto Adam if he sinned?  He had to die.  We have to establish what the curse was.  It was not hell.</p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 1</p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong>Genesis 2:16-17</strong>  </span><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of 
        the garden thou mayest freely eat: But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely 
        die.</strong> Man was never made to die in the beginning.  Man was made in the image and  likeness of God.  Can God die?  He did not say I am going to make him something like me.  We 
        have to get a hold of these things.  We have to believe the word of God or throw the whole thing out.  If we are made in the image and likeness of God, and because Adam sinned and 
        disobeyed and brought death on mankind, then the Redeemer has come, that we might be delivered from all the curse of the law from the beginning.  That was a law unto Adam, that you 
        obey my commandment and keep it; that you do not eat of that thing that I have told you not to touch. </p>

    <p class="w3-justify">This is the kingdom message by the way: that you do not die; that you live.  He taught the message of the gospel, and then he also taught the message of the kingdom, 
        which is entirely different.  The message of the kingdom of heaven is spirit, the spirit life.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify">So the curse of Adam was death not hell.  Hell was made for Satan and for those that follow him.  So the curse is not hell.  The curse that was put on man was death; 
        that he would die, that he could not live any longer.  And death started working in Adam the minute he did it – he didn’t die right that second.  Death started to work in him the 
        minute he disobeyed God, and finally he died.  And man has died ever since.  When Jesus died, or as the scripture says, he was planted in the earth in death, one seed that many might 
        spring forth thereof; he died to bring forth much fruit.</p>

    
    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong>Isaiah 53:10</strong>  </span><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him;</strong> Jesus 
        <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of 
        the Lord shall prosper in his hand.</strong> We are his seed, so anything that is promised to him is ours.  And I will get to why he had to die to bring this to pass; because he had to 
        die to break the curse that the rest of us would not have to.  The same as he died for our sins that we could be forgiven.</p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray" style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 2</p>    
        
    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red">Isaiah 56:4-5<strong></strong>  </span><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> For thus saith the Lord unto the eunuchs</strong> Now you know 
        what a eunuch is.  They are male and female – there is no difference in the spirit – those that walk pure and holy and clean in their bodies, forsaking all sin.  There is more to it 
        than just what we have been taught.  Forsaking all sin. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">that keep my sabbaths, and choose the things that please me, and take hold of my</strong> 
        Command, or my <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">covenant;</strong> That takes hold of this thing.  That grasps a hold of it and claims it for your own.  You can hear this stuff 
        forever and you just let it go over your head and it will just keep flying away.  You have to reach out and take hold of these commands that God has promised us and put them to work 
        and receive them in our hearts. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">Even unto them</strong> That take hold of my covenant. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> will I give in mine house 
        and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters: I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.</strong> Or taken away in death.  This is 
        an everlasting name.  He said I will give you an everlasting name that will not be cut off.</p>    

    <p class="w3-justify">Fasting is denying oneself.  What we call fasting is denying ourself of food, but there is a much, much greater meaning that we haven't taught on yet.  The fasting, 
        the taking a hold of our flesh in refusing to let it do what the mind tells it to do; taking a hold of yourself and bringing yourself under subjection to the Spirit of God, that we will 
        not let that flesh run rampant, but that we will get a hold of it and shake yourself.  Get a hold of your collar.  Call yourself by name and say, "I refuse to let you do that.  That is 
        not the way God wants it."  If you feel like opening your mouth at the wrong time, if you cannot do anything else, slap your hand over your mouth when you feel like speaking.  These are 
        supposed to be pure, pure vessels with not bitter and sweet coming out of the same vessel.  If you cannot keep your mouth shut, tie a handkerchief around your face, if nothing else, if 
        you have to do that kind of a restraint.  But in the name of the Lord, keep your mouth shut from speaking evil, from speaking about one another, from slandering someone, from foul 
        language coming out.  He said it should not be so that there is both good and evil coming out of the same vessel.  It is not godly.  But the flesh is a deceiver.  Remember that.  And 
        the flesh is full of putrid vomit.  This is why we have to take control of and put everything, every part of the flesh, under subjection to the Spirit if we ever expect to come into the 
        kingdom of God.  And we can only do it as we keep the commandment of the Lord, what he tells us.  I don’t mean the Ten Commandments especially, although we ought to keep them too.  
        Because Jesus said that even a greater commandment he gave, that we would love every one.</p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 3</p>   

    <p class="w3-justify">Jesus was born.  Jesus came as an absolute flesh man.  Do you realize that?  He had two eyes and a mouth, two feet to walk with.  He was tempted, the Bible says, "in 
        all points like as we."  And there has been no temptation that man has ever had, that Jesus didn't have.  You mean he looked at a woman and, oh yes, he did.  That is what it says.  The 
        Bible is not a lie.  It says he was tempted in all points like as we, yet without sin, because he never yielded to it.  He got himself under control.  He never sinned, otherwise he 
        could not have been a sacrifice for our sin.  We could never have been saved.  We would be lost, every one of us.  He was of the seed of God the Father.  He was not of the seed of a 
        man, because she had never known a man, but he was of the seed planted by the Holy Ghost, the scripture says.  But his physical was flesh man.  He got tired just like you get tired.  
        He worked just like the rest of you work, in his father's carpentry shop.  He had to learn just like we have to learn.  And he prepared himself for 30 years.  For 30 years, he prepared 
        himself, a man in the earth walking as a flesh earth man, seeing everything that you see.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify">You cannot accept this message or any other message of the kingdom until you have established that in your hearts, that he was a flesh man.  We have him such a super 
        being.  He is a super being, you understand, because he was the only Son of God, the true Son of God that came out of God the Father, but he also said that he is bringing many Sons to 
        glory with himself, many that will be just like him.  This is very well established in the scriptures, all through the scriptures, that that was the purpose of his coming: not just for 
        salvation, that your soul might be saved in eternal life, but that he also might bring a kingdom people forth to take the kingdom out of Satan's hands, of this world, that it might go 
        back unto the Father, the ruler of all.  And he has used man from the beginning for everything that he has done, always.  He started out with a man, Adam.  Adam failed.  He put him over 
        the works of his hands.  That is what the Bible says.  So through sin he has fallen.  And now, so God sends his Son (Or lets his Son come.  Sends him, it says in one place.  In another 
        place, it says he comes by his own will.) and after preparing himself for 30 years to remove death or the penalty of death from his flesh; that is what Jesus had to do.  He was born 
        with a flesh body.  You notice he could die like any man, don’t you?  Because he died.  But he died that we would not have to.  He took all of our sins on himself that we can be 
        cleansed from that sin.  So he also took death on himself so that we would not have to die.  Just like our sins can be taken away, so has death been taken away.  I know this might 
        sound terribly foreign to some of you, but it is so plain to me.  It is more plain than salvation is to me – this message.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify">He had to become a flesh man and he had to take authority over the flesh, over his own flesh before he could willingly lay down his life for us.  He laid it down 
        willingly.  He said, "No man taketh my life from me.  No man taketh my life from me but I lay it down willingly."  But he had to completely overcome all sin in his flesh that he was 
        born with.  He had no manifested sin, you understand, but he became sin for us.  He took all of our sin.  Before he could present himself spotless; I want to tell you something, his 
        death did not make him spotless, no more than our death will make us spotless, if we die.  I want to show you a mystery.  It is such a deep hidden mystery in the scriptures. He had to 
        prepare himself, just like we have to prepare ourselves, to make ourselves spotless.</p>

        <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray" style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 4</p>    

    <p class="w3-justify">Do you think he would say to make ourselves spotless – that he is coming for a people without spot or wrinkle or any such thing and then not make us able to do it?  
        He has made the way.  Jesus made the way for us.  He had to make himself spotless before the Father.  That his sacrifice was sufficient for us to become spotless Sons of God, no sin 
        in the flesh.  I could teach on this for a week and never get it half said.  If you once get a picture of what Jesus really has done for us: his overcoming, tempted on all points like 
        as we are, and yet walked through the earth without sin that he might be a sacrifice for us.  Not just to cover our sins, not for salvation alone, although many will just be saved, 
        praise God for that, then go on the death way and so on and so forth.  But there is a group that is coming forth to inherit the kingdom of God that will overcome sin in the flesh and 
        that will walk spotless before the Father in complete obedience that we might be sin free.  That root of sin which caused the death in Adam – because he let sin come in through 
        disobedience to God – that root that is in man when you are born can be taken out by the Spirit as we walk in obedience to God in all things.  And this is the plan of God.  No wonder 
        there is only going to be 144,000 out of the whole earth.  Do you realize that?  The initial ones will be 144,000.  I know that the Lord has shown me some things: that there will be 
        many who will come in, many that will come in afterwards, but at the beginning, there will be 144,000.  The scripture is very plain on it.  There has been a lot of false teaching on 
        that, about who they are. </p>

    <p class="w3-justify">The most necessary of Jesus' suffering came before the cross.  The worst suffering was not at the cross.  Oh sure, it hurt his flesh.  But the worst suffering was to 
        be spit upon, to be rejected, to be misunderstood continually.  Nobody understood a word he said.  They rejected him on every point.  He said, "What good deed are you after me for now?  
        What good deed did I do that you are out after me to kill me?  Because I healed this man on the sabbath day?  Because I opened the blind man's eyes?  Is that what you want to kill me 
        for?"  He was also showing us what is going to happen to us when we come into this.  This is the kind of suffering that hurts when it gets down inside where you are, when you are 
        rejected and you know you are rejected.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify">When we go through these trials, if we can understand that why we go through these things is that we are being conformed to his image.  That is scripture again.  
        Being conformed to his image and unto his death, this suffering that the flesh might become pure.  We must go through these times of rejection, through all of this stuff.  So instead 
        of shutting our mouth and taking it and letting God do the work in us, our big mouth just starts blabbing.  We have to cry.  We have to squall.  We have to do all sorts of things to 
        upset everybody in the whole community if we can.</p>

        

    <p class="w3-justify">It is easy for me to understand, being a Christian for so many years and I look back and when I see each one of you kids go through things.  I just sit back, and I 
        cannot say a word.  I have to be still.  Because I know I could give you the answer to what you are going through.  I know that, because I have been through all of this stuff.  But I 
        don't dare to give you the answer, because you have to go through it and learn for yourself.  Amen.  That is the way we learn, and that is the way we overcome.  But if I tell you how 
        to overcome it, you wouldn't overcome.  You would just automatically do that thing, but you really would not have taken that thing out of your flesh that God wants out of there.</p>
    
    <p class="w3-justify">So the most necessary part of Jesus' suffering came before his death as he put down all temptation.  That is the hardest thing in the world to do, is to put down 
        temptation, because this flesh is deceitful: to put down temptation without sin as he did.  "He was tempted in all points like as we."  And the next part of it is, "Yet without 
        sin."</p>
