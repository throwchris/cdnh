    <p class="w3-justify">To be tempted is not sin.  It is not sin to be tempted.  But when we yield to the temptation, then it becomes sin.  It was not sin for Adam to be tempted in the 
      garden.  That was not sin, but when he yielded to the temptation, then it was sin.  And then the minute he yielded to that temptation, death set in, because God had told him that it 
      would.  God never fails in his word.  But Jesus never one time gave in to sin.  But remember through this all, his Spirit was pure.  He was the pure Son of God by the Spirit.</p>   
  

    <p class="w3-justify">Our spirits are pure because it is the God given part of us.  Aren't you glad?  Our spirits are pure.  Aren’t we all glad for that?  And God looketh on the heart of 
      man.  We judge wrongly, but he judges righteously.  So his temptation, that he was tempted to do, sin – he had to give his flesh as a sacrifice for our sin for the original curse, Amen.  
      As he conquered sin in the flesh, we have this promise of life without death because Jesus overcame that curse of death.  You have to keep reminding yourself now, what the curse is.  
      The curse was death not hell.  The curse was death and he in this last day, will raise up a people that will not die, that cannot die, because they believe the Word of God.  God has given 
      me some insights into this.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">Jesus was the first kingdom man, the first man in the kingdom of God while he walked the earth without sin, tempted in all points, but he walked out the kingdom 
      right there for the 33 years that he lived.  He walked it out.  He walked out that perfect kingdom man in the earth as an example unto us, for us, showing and proving that a man of flesh, 
      or a woman of flesh, can walk without sin in the earth.  Now we cannot do it unless we are born again, because we are born in sin and you cannot get rid of it.  Only God can get rid of 
      it.  We have no control over this nature that we are born with.  I have said many times, you take a little child, as soon as it is born and it is old enough to respond in any way, you do 
      not have to teach it to lie.  You do not have to teach it to steal.  All you have to say is, "Don't touch that, son," and when your back is turned he will get it, and he will hide it 
      behind his back and you will say, "Do you have that?"  And he will say, "No."  That is because he is born with this thing.  That is that sin nature that is in us.  And if we will fully 
      obey the voice of the Lord and of the Spirit, we can walk on into that perfect kingdom: that restored kingdom of God.  Now if this is not so, I am sure fooled.  But either we have to 
      believe the Word of God, the whole Word of God about the kingdom and what it is or we won't come into it, because he says we cannot have faith unless we hear.  When we hear the Word, it 
      brings faith to us.  Amen.  So we can come into this kingdom and be like Adam was before he sinned.  That was the purpose: that we would become pure.  Sin is the only reason we cannot 
      fulfill this promise.  Sin in us is the only thing that will keep us from living forever, because sin was the only thing that caused death in the beginning.</p>
      
      
   

    <p class="w3-justify">Now that ought to make you really strive to live without sin, to correct these bodies, to watch ourselves.  And you won't overcome it overnight.  I am not saying that 
      tomorrow now, you are going to be a perfect being.  As we learn a little by little as we are tempted, and as we put sin down, and as we pray, as we seek God, and as our hearts are honest 
      towards God.  So I say, sin is the only reason that we cannot fulfill this promise, for the curse of death was brought to us by Adam's sin.  Thus, all flesh except Elijah and Enoch, and 
      they were counted perfect before God.  I do not know how they got a hold of this secret, but they did and they did not die, right?  They were taken, Elijah and Enoch, those two.  They 
      were the only two that were ever taken out, as far as I know, without death.  Even Jesus had to die for us that we could be taken up the same way: that we could come into the kingdom 
      without dying.</p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray" style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 6</p> 

    
    <p class="w3-justify">But the promise in this day is to us, if we put away all sin from our flesh, and serve and keep the commandments of God.  That's a big thing.  It is so easy to say, 
      but it is such a big thing when somebody does something to you and you want to haul off and – you see, that is sin.  We have to become dead to sin, in other words dead to this carnal 
      nature.  He says when they reviled against him, he reviled not.  He did not turn back and do the same thing they had done.  He learned to be still and quiet before his Father.  When they 
      pulled his beard out, he did not reach out and pull their beards out, did he?  He really went through it.  And we think we are going to get by with any less?  He is our example.  We will 
      have to go through the same things.</p>
    
    
    <p class="w3-justify">If some of you are going through some hard things, just remember you are called.  You know, you walked in such a high place there when you were first saved.  
      Remember?  It was just great.  God just took care of everything.  You received the baptism of the Holy Ghost, and if I had told you what you were going to go through – that it lights 
      the fire instantly, to be persecuted.  The minute you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost, God starts a work in you that will kill this flesh.  And he will start bringing things to 
      this flesh; but he also, through the Holy Ghost, gives you power to resist, if you will seek the Spirit in it and if you will try.  So the Holy Ghost is given to you, the Holy Ghost and 
      fire, to burn out of us, all of this old Adamic nature that we are born with.  That is what the Holy Ghost is for.  But if I tell people that before they receive the Holy Ghost, they get 
      scared.  The minute Jesus was baptized in the Holy Ghost, he was led away into the wilderness to be tempted of Satan: to be purified in other words.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">God has to call some out of the churches, some he is calling that are called into this high order of God, to come forth as perfected Sons for the ruling and reigning.  
      And Jesus says, "If you suffer with me, then you will reign with me."  In the kingdom.  So that is what it is all about for every one of us.  And anyone who has ever really received the 
      baptism of the Holy Ghost is going to have to suffer persecution if you are called to the high order of God.  Now everybody that is baptized in the Holy Ghost – it seems like they don't 
      have to go through this like those that are called.</p>
      
      
  

    <p class="w3-justify">You are going to become pure gold with every bit of dross taken out.  And all that dross is the sin nature that has to come out so you can walk in the kingdom with 
      Christ.  Amen.  It is worth it, believe me.  It is terrible at the time, but it is worth it.  Amen.  Die to all flesh desires and live in, and by, God's Spirit.  Live in God's Spirit and 
      by God's Spirit and for God and nothing else, not looking for this temporal world out here and what it can bring, but what the Father can give me.  How can I live?  I have to please the 
      Father. How can I live just to please him?  How can I walk just to do the will of the Father?  That is what Jesus came for, and he is our example, just to do the will of the Father.  
      Isn’t that what he said?  Just to do the will of the Father.</p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 7</p>  
      
    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong>Proverbs 12:28</strong>  </span><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> In the way of righteousness</strong> Doing things right with God 
      just the way he wants it, that is righteousness. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> is life; and in the pathway thereof there is no death.</strong> If we walk in righteousness – mark 
      this in your Bibles, Proverbs 12:28.</p>
      
    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong>Proverbs 12:28 </strong>  </span><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> In the way of righteousness is life;</strong> That means life 
      in the flesh, not to die. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> and in the pathway thereof</strong> The pathway of righteousness <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> there is no 
      death.</strong> What are you going to do with that scripture, everybody?  That is God's Word too. I have many, many scriptures about this at home, where I have studied on it in years 
      past. But this one, he gave me today, without looking for it.  In the pathway of righteousness, there is no death. When we become right, totally right with God, this flesh totally 
      subject to the Spirit of God, you cannot die.</p>  
    

    <p class="w3-justify">It is impossible because the curse has to be lifted.  When the curse was put on because of sin, the minute all sin is gone out of the flesh, you just naturally live 
      because that curse is lifted.  Isn't that simple?  Since sin caused death, when all sin is gone, death is gone.  That is so simple we just fall over it.  Stumble our feet and stub our 
      nose.  It is just as simple as that.  If sin caused death, then when sin is gone, as we walk with God and put everything under subjection to God's rule, and keep his perfect law and 
      righteousness, which we do as we walk and put down the flesh and the temptations, he gradually removes these roots of sin out of us.  When that is gone, then we cannot die because the 
      curse is lifted.  If you meet the requirements of God, then the curse is gone, because he is faithful.</p>
      
      
   

    <p class="w3-justify">Jesus didn't know all that we think that he knew when he was going through that.  Otherwise, it would have been very easy for him.  The heavens were not opened unto 
      him until he was baptized.  Now the heavens being opened to him was his understanding and his relationship, that close relationship with the Father where he knew who he was.  Now he may 
      have known some things, just like we know that we are called into this purpose.  We know what our calling is.  We are called to be Sons of God like himself, but until God opens the 
      heavens or the understanding of our minds and of our hearts – this is why sometimes I cannot tell you when you are going through something.  You have to struggle through it, to learn by 
      the Spirit to overcome.  All I can say is, "Oh, wait awhile.  It will be all right.  Well, wait a little while.  It will all be all right.  Just give it a little more time.  God is 
      throwing a little more coal in there, and making a little hotter fire."  But eventually it all works out, but at the time you think the whole world is upside down, you have backslid, 
      you think you are 10,000 miles from God.  God says, "Just hold steady.  I'm just doing a work in you."  Amen.  I am just giving you a few secrets, Amen.  "I just have to do that work in 
      you, otherwise you can't be my Son."  And that is what this is all about.</p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray" style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 8</p>  

    
    <p class="w3-justify">If I thought that I couldn't come into the kingdom, I'd say, "Lord, take me now. What am I wasting my time for?  I'm no good to you."  But I know that I am called to 
      the order of the kingdom and that I cannot die, because he has spoken it so many times to me; and not only to me, but I have had preachers almost lose their tongue when they would be 
      prophesying fast over me maybe 20 years ago and they would say, "You shall never die."  Because it would come out by the Spirit and it would shock them half to death.  The Spirit knows.  
      We don't know, but the Spirit knows, so he speaks it through their mouth.</p>
    
    
    <p class="w3-justify">Well, praise God.  Praise God.  And I am healthier, too.  Amen.  Because I do not live by my own power but by the power of God and by his Spirit, because I am trying 
      to walk in obedience to everything that he requires.  Death has to leave.  You see, aging is death.  That ought to be good for you people who want face lifts and all that good stuff.  
      Serve God, Amen.  You tell me I am 71 years old.  I know, not because I think I am super, but I know if there is any life in me at all, it is because of the Spirit of the Father that 
      dwells in me and lives in me.  Amen.  Amen.  And it is going to get better, and God is no respecter of persons.  That is what I love about him, Amen.  He will do for everyone if you walk 
      in obedience to God.  What he will do for one, he will do for another and for the rest of the whole world if they walk in obedience. Amen.</p>
      
        
    

    <p class="w3-justify">Jesus did not really know who he was until he was baptized by John.  Do you remember what the Father spoke right out loud, "Thou art my Son."  Can you imagine?  He 
      had read about himself in the scriptures and wondered, and his mother told him who he was, what the angel had spoken unto her, and for the Lord to speak it openly out loud when he was 
      being baptized, "Thou art my Son."  Can you imagine how he felt when the Holy Ghost – he was baptized in the Holy Ghost at that time?  And what did the Spirit do?  Immediately took him 
      into the wilderness to be tempted.  Immediately.  It said he was driven by the Holy Spirit to be tempted by Satan.  What for?  That he might completely overcome this flesh so he could 
      fulfill the ministry that the Father had given him to do.  Now from that moment on, he knew who he was, without question, because the heavens were opened and the Father spoke.  He had an 
      open door, but he had to be tempted from the time of his birth up to that point.  Now think of it.  Oh, I've just got – all over me by the Spirit – such an anointing of the Spirit.</p>   
  
    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 9</p>  

    <p class="w3-justify">God wants you to hear this message today. And then it was revealed to him in a greater measure when Satan says to him, "If thou be the Son of God."  I suppose he 
      said, "I wonder if I really am.  Oh yes, I know I heard the Father speak."  He had a faith walk too.  "If thou be the Son of God, cause these stones to be made bread."  Can you imagine 
      Christ going through that and what must have gone on in his mind, because he had a flesh mind too.  Like we have.  Something the Lord showed me: Satan, when he said, "If thou be the Son 
      of God…"  It worked on Eve, "Did God say?"  It worked on Eve and she fell.  But it did not work on Jesus Christ.  Aren't you glad?  It just did not work because he knew who he was.  And 
      if we do not know who we are and what our call is in God, Satan will just trip you up and tie your legs and tie your hands and just mess you up all of the time, if you don't know who you 
      are.  Just say, "Satan, get going.  I know who I am.  In God, I know who I am.  I know that I am a Son of God, Amen, because that is my call, because Jesus was a Son of God and he made 
      the way that I might become a Son of the everlasting God, Amen, that I might become an eternal being that shall not see death."</p> 
     
          

    <p class="w3-justify">For you that are called, and I believe every one of you is called if you will follow through with it.  I don't think you would be here if you were not called.  I know 
      you are called, because I know it by what the Lord has spoken to me.  So when the kids want to go everywhere else, and they want to do everything else that is ungodly… [Did you ever 
      receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost yet?  You haven't, have you, and spoken in tongues?  Did you?  Did he speak that night?  Yes, he did.  Yes, he did receive.  Well then, if you have, 
      that is fine.  The Spirit will work with you.  Amen.</p>
    
    <p class="w3-justify">Someday God will take care of that, too, when he wants it taken care of.  Right now, I'd remember too much about you, all of you, if he gave me that mind back that I 
      used to have, where I never forgot anything.  It was like a computer.  He has done away with that, and I praise God for it.  This way you can tell me something today and I will forget it 
      tomorrow.  So then, if I have to minister to you, I can just come up to you and minister, and forgot you even told me.  Amen.</p> 
           
  

    <p class="w3-justify">I can see why God has to do this thing.  I am not fighting about it and it doesn't embarrass me.  I belong to God.  He can do whatever he wants to – chop my legs 
      off – that is his business, right?  Not mine.  You know, if you own something, it is really yours.  You do as you please with that thing.  And I am just a thing that God has chosen, that 
      he might put himself into, he and his Son to dwell in, to bring forth glory unto God – not unto myself but glory unto the Father.  Amen.  That is what we are for.]</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">Now Jesus was and is, according to the scriptures, the new Adam man.  The Scripture says that he is the second Adam.  Amen.</p>
