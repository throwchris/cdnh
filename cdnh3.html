    <p class="w3-justify">For you that are Bible students, you know what I am saying.  There was a first Adam.  There was also a second Adam.  Jesus was and is the new Adam that leads man back 
        to life. [But I lay on my face, flat on the floor this morning and I said, "Well God, I'll just lie here awhile, and whatever you want, it is all right with me."  And I just got tired.  
        I said, "Well, Lord, that's all right."  Finally, I felt kind of drawn a little bit by the Spirit, so I got up and … Amen.]</p>   
  

    <p class="w3-justify">Jesus was and is the new Adam that leads man back to life.  Now what happened at the transfiguration was a sign that he had overcome all flesh and was changed.  He had 
        a new birth in him.  This is brand new.  I have not taught on it before, but the Lord was giving me things on this third work in the Spirit.  Amen.  This was the change and he was 
        manifested.  Remember, he was in that flesh body at the time of his transfiguration.  This was before his death, when he changed into that glorious light which you are reading about, 
        completely changed, but this was a sign unto him.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">Do you remember what I told you some years ago about the experience I had where my body became a body of light and my beads (necklace) were hanging out here?  I saw 
        the beads but not my body.  I believe this goes back clear to there and me not realizing what it meant.  It scared me almost to death.  I was sitting in a chair.  I had a vision of 
        Jesus right above me.  All I could see was his feet and his skirts.  My heart was so crying out.  He was slowly moving up above me very, very slowly.  And I was crying.  I had a 
        houseful of people.  We were having a meeting.  The Spirit of God was just tremendous in the room.  And my heart was crying.  Can you imagine how you would feel if you saw Jesus and 
        all of a sudden, he was gradually leaving you?  My heart was just pulling out toward him, "Lord, Lord, Lord, don't leave.  Lord, don't leave.  Please Lord, don't leave.  Come back.  
        Come back."  He finally just disappeared.  And dejected, I looked down and I had no body, but these big beads that we used to wear with a knot in them, were setting in the form of my 
        body here.  I saw the beads but nothing else.  I was completely changed, completely disappeared.  It scared me almost to death.  I did not know if I died.  I did not know what had 
        happened.  But then I came back in just a short time.  I came back to my normal self.  I do not know if this was a type of this thing that happened even way back there or at least it 
        was some kind of a sign to me of the supernatural of God.</p>   
   

    <p class="w3-justify">I know that there was a new birth that took place in Jesus at that time (the transfiguration), a birth of the Spirit.  But his death was necessary, that he might 
        overcome death for us that we need not die.  The Word says that we must enter the kingdom through much tribulation, much suffering, through much sorrow, through much heartache, 
        through much understanding.  Tribulation is a terrible word.</p>
        
        <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 11</p>    

    
    <p class="w3-justify">The transfiguration changed his body by the birth of the flesh by the Spirit.  I am surprised he could die after that. It was a birth, a birth of the flesh.  He had 
        completely overcome sin in his life at that time and so there was a birth that came forth of the flesh.  Every mark of his natural mortal or flesh existence was replaced by a spiritual 
        heavenly existence.  I have never heard it taught anywhere, but you see there had to be a change in him, Amen, in his flesh after all of this sin.  And it had to be, so that we could 
        have an example.  It was replaced by the spiritual heavenly existence.  It was a new birth, which we will experience as told in 1 John 3.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong>1 John 3:2-9</strong>  </span><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear 
        what we shall be: </strong>Now we have not had that changing of the flesh yet. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">but we know that, when he shall appear,</strong> Now how many times 
        have we had scriptures showing that when he shall appear, we shall be like him?  And those who are looking for him shall find him.  The appearing is going to do something to us.  And 
        I know that I have had many prophecies concerning him, that he is going to appear to me, and he is going to appear to each one of us individually in his proper timing.  And I guarantee 
        you, it won't be a dream or a vision.  He will appear and we will be changed.  We will be changed. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall 
        be like him; for we shall see him</strong> or know him <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">as he is.</strong> Then we will know – it's hard to grasp isn't it?  Let's do it again. 
         <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">Beloved, now are we the sons of God,</strong></p>    
    
    
    <p class="w3-justify">We are already the Sons of God. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be 
        like him; for we shall see him as he is.</strong> I wrote a little thing on my refrigerator that the Lord spoke to me one day.  It says, "To see him is to know him."  I thought, 
        "Lord, what are you saying to me?"  "To see him is to know him."  We cannot be like him until we know him.  We do not really know him yet.  We know that he is Jesus Christ the Savior 
        of the world, but when he really reveals himself in his sinless nature unto us, and he changes us into that nature when he appears to us, that change will come and then we will know 
        him just like he knew the Father.  We will know all things.  It will just be there. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even 
        as he is pure.</strong> This message, you will want to make yourself pure.  Believe me you are going to try to clean your lives up if there is anything in your life that is not like 
        him.  We purify ourselves. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.</strong> This hope that he will appear 
        unto us.  That's the beauty. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law. And ye know that he was 
        manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin. Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not:</strong>Now we have not come quite to that place of abiding in him continually yet.  He is 
        working on us.  <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">whosoever sinneth hath not seen him,</strong> We have not seen him yet.  Is that clear to you? <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">
        Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him.</strong> </p>
        
    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray" style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 12</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">But when he appears, then we are going to be like him for we will see him as he is. That's what it says up in verse two, right? <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">
        Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he </strong> Christ <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">is righteous.</strong> Isn't that 
        beautiful?  But we are not completely righteous yet.  We are working at it.  Amen.  And I get a slap in the chest every time I say this.  Amen. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">
        He that committeth sin is of the devil;</strong> Remember when he said we are walking after the devil's plan, the flesh man, when he says, "You are of your father the devil"?  They 
        were looking after the flesh and not after the Spirit.  We get a different understanding of this now, don't we?  Do you understand what I am saying? <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">
        He that committeth sin is of the devil;</strong> We are walking after the old nature of Adam that caused Eve, in the garden, to commit sin.  So if you are sinning, you know you are not 
        pure yet, Amen. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested,</strong> or made known
        <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">that he might destroy the works of the devil.</strong> </p>   
  

    <p class="w3-justify">The works of the flesh, the flesh man and not after the Spirit. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin;</strong> Once this 
        happens like at the transfiguration, you won't commit sin.  This sin problem will be done away with. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">for his seed</strong> God's seed 
        <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.</strong> Now do you understand these scriptures?  Isn't that simple?  Do you wonder 
        why we sin?  We haven't really been born of God.  This is worth teaching, isn't it?  You ought to be so high on this.  You have to step real high and just go out there and tramp Satan 
        down everywhere you see him in your life and get rid of him. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin;</strong> Now we know we sin.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">I have to say it.  I can't help it.  God says I do not sin.  And he keeps saying it, and saying it, and saying it, and saying it to me, and I can't help it, but God 
        has changed me.  I have to say it.  I have to admit it.  I can't keep still any longer because he keeps hitting me with the Spirit.  He is hitting me with the Spirit every time I say 
        it.  This is why he has worked with me all of these years.  This is why my body changed.  I am just getting an understanding of why I disappeared and became just a light instead of a 
        flesh person.</p>   
   

    <p class="w3-justify">He had spoken to me years ago.  I asked him, "Why am I not tempted?  Why am I not tempted any more?"  Some years ago.  "I am tempted with nothing."  And he said, so 
        sweet, "I have removed the root of sin."  But I did not even know what it meant until today, really what he was saying until today, that the root of sin has been removed.  This is why 
        I am not tempted: because there is nothing in there to tempt.  Satan cannot tempt it.  He has no part of me.  Jesus said, "You have no part of me, Satan."  So I am not tempted to 
        steal.  I am not tempted to lie and those things: because God has chosen to do it, not in my goodness.  I did not even know what he was doing, but that I might be an example unto 
        others and others could come in as a flesh person in the earth.  That is why Jesus died and did all of this, that we might have this.  This is why he says I cannot die: because I don't 
        live by my life, but I live by the life of the Son of God, who is ageless.  So I will just drop that, but I could not stand it.  I had to say it.  That is why the Spirit was dealing 
        with me very strongly and he might have whopped me good.  Amen.</p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 13</p>    

    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong>1 John 5:1-4</strong>  </span><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of

        loveth him also that is begotten of him</strong> If we love Christ, then we are going to love everybody that he loves.  That is our pattern.  Everybody that he loves, we are going to 
        love.  And you cannot change it.  That is just the way it is.  It is in you.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and 
        keep his commandments.</strong> It is not quite finished yet, but we are coming along, Amen, when we keep his commandments. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">For this is the love of 
        God, that we keep his commandments:</strong> That is the love of God.  We cannot have it any other way until we completely keep his commandments. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">

        allow ourselves to be taken in the snares of Satan at Satan's will. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And we know that we are of God, and the whole world</strong> The flesh man, 
        anybody, Christians or not, that walks in this flesh realm in the world and does not walk in the Spirit, he says, "If you walk in the Spirit you will not fulfill the lust of the 
        flesh."  Well, the lust of the flesh is sin.  There is a sin unto death and there is a sin not unto death.  Now we are starting to get an understanding of what he is saying: the 
        nominal Christian and the Sons of God.  These were all mysteries, weren't they?  How beautiful it is, how the Lord is giving us understanding. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">lieth 
        in wickedness. And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding,</strong> Now we are getting an understanding. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> that we may 
        know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.</strong> We know that Christ is in us, but do we know that 
        we are in him?  There is the difference. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, and we may know him that is 
        true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ.</strong> It is wonderful to know that God the Father and God the Son and God the Holy Ghost dwell inside, but it is 
        another thing to be born by God, to be born to where we are in him.  Amen.</p>   

    
    <p class="w3-justify">When we reach that place where we put down all sin in our lives, by the Spirit, as we follow God – now you can't just go out and say, "I am not going to do that 
        again," because you still have that root in you, but as God leads you.  Follow after God closely.  Just let him lead you.  He is not going to destroy you, but you think that you are 
        going to get killed for sure, and he wants it that way.  Maybe I am saying more than I ought to say.  Sin is a different thing than what we have looked on.  Sin is death and this is 
        what he is trying to bring out today: that as long as this sin nature is in there, you are going to die and be buried.  But when this nature is taken out through obedience to the 
        Spirit, as we follow all of the commandments of God as he speaks to us individually: then when that root is gone, you just naturally have life.</p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray" style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 14</p>    

    <p class="w3-justify">Jesus cannot die again and has made the way for a kingdom people to rule and reign with him.  I do not care how many bullets they shoot at you, once you have passed 
        through that gate.  I do not care what happens.  I do not care how many doctors tell you, you are going to die, you are going to laugh in their face and say, "Ha ha.  It is not so."  
        Amen.</p>   
  

    <p class="w3-justify">Jesus had gained eternal life in the flesh at the transfiguration, or that was the birthing of Jesus Christ after the Spirit, the complete birthing of Jesus Christ 
        after the Spirit man, even though he was the Son of God.  And his death was for us, that we should not die.  There is something for thought.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">For all of you that can hear it, hear it.  If not, do not fuss about it.  Do not worry about it.  Put it on the shelf a little while.  Walk with God.  Do not be 
        afraid.  I used to hear some messages years ago that scared me almost to death.  Honest.  It scared me almost to death.  I would say, "They are crazier than bedbugs.  They don't have 
        any idea of what they are saying." Because I had a whole different concept of the scriptures.  I could not receive it.  I just put it away.  I would not run and tell everybody and tear 
        the message all up and get all excited about it.  I would fight the battle out in here, where God wanted the battle fought, because the battle was between God and me, not the people, 
        because half of them wouldn't understand either.</p>
        
    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 15</p>   
   

    <p class="w3-justify">If you run to people for an answer, all you get is confusion.  Remember that prophecy that was one of the things in the New Order of God?  It was not to run to man 
        but to seek God, because these are new revelations of God that he is bringing forth in the last days that he told Daniel he would bring forth.  And these are new things that he is 
        bringing forth to bring us.  He's more anxious that we come into the kingdom then we are to get there, because he must bring forth this kingdom people to rule and reign and take the 
        kingdom out of Satan's hands.  Satan deceived man and stopped Adam from fulfilling what God wanted to do.  It was all in God's plan; he could not do anything except God allowed it.  
        But now he is bringing forth a faith people by the Spirit to take the kingdom out of Satan's hands; that we might rule and reign on this earth in perfect righteousness, and that the 
        earth might become the garden of Eden again, as far as sin is concerned: that we might rule and reign.</p>

    
    <p class="w3-justify">Look at the scriptures.  He says, "If you are faithful in few things, I will make you rulers over cities and over nations."  That is just one of those scriptures.  
        But it is saying something, isn't it?  We are to rule and reign.  He says, "To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me on my throne."  That throne speaks of authority and 
        rulership, not a throne per se, that you can lay your hands on.  If you have a throne, then you have a kingdom.  If you have a kingdom, then you have to have a people.  Amen.  That 
        is what he is saying.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify">He says, "I, the Lord, desire a Church of my making, not of the order of the religious spirit of man or of an old anointing, but of and unto perfect order and love 
        in my Father's house."  Where is the Father's house?  He says, "Where are you going to build a house for me?"  He dwells not in temples made with hands, but he said his kingdom is 
        without observation.  You can't see it because it is hid in the heart of man.  Amen.</p>
